<h2 id="first">Role of Political Parties</h2>
<p>Originally in 1789 there were no American political parties when George Washington was inaugurated. However, due to the North and South differing in industry vs. farming, resulting in the South believing strongly in farmers’ and states’ rights while the North supported tariffs to increase the value of their manufactured goods. This lead to Hamilton's Federalist party in 1791 , which wanted the national government to pay off all debt, implement a National Banking System, and stricter tariffs in support of the North. On the other hand, Thomas Jefferson created the Anti-Federalist Party, or the Democratic-Republicans in support of the South. Though these were the original parties, the ideals of the Federalists become those of the newly formed Republican party, while Southern Democracy, which wanted to support poor farmers,  evolved from the Anti-Federalists. Unfortunately this fed into a rivalry that Washington feared. For example, in 1872, many Southern freedmen favored the Republican party as they had supported abolition while their owners, Southern white democrats, strictly opposed it. However, disliking how the sudden population of blacks could vote, (and towards the opposite party) a group of Southern Democrats massacred hundreds of freedmen in Colfax, Louisiana. This event reveals the impact and rivalry of these political parties. However, they weren’t alone, as more political parties began to form in order to advance their economic and political goals.</p><br>
	<p>For example, in the early 20th century, the Populist Party along with the Farmers’ alliance wanted political reform for the “tramp,” poor cotton or wheat farmers in the South and West. They believed the main problem in society was immense political corruption and economic inequality,  and desired to reform democracy. The party believed that the main way to address their issue was to strengthen the nation’s currency, with “unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the present legal ratio of 16:1,” as well as a graduated income tax.  As for property, they wanted the government to seize control of the railroads in order to reduce the power of various political machines. Western land owned by corporal powers or natives should also be reclaimed by the government and redistributed. Likewise, the newly formed Progressive party in 1912 desired a more democratic “welfare state,” as well as government prevention of corrupt company practices, though also appealed to minorities like urban factory workers, black citizens, and female activists who desired women’s suffrage. However, they called for an eight hour workday, social insurance that would cover the costs of unemployment, and focused more on education and health, as well as implement minimum wage. They also want to transfer power from the Court to Congress, with the Legislature gaining the opportunity to While both parties wanted to benefit the common citizen, the Populist party tended to do this by limiting the power of the high upper class, while Progressivists wanted the lower class and various minorities to directly obtain more power.</p><br>
<p>	However, all political parties wanted a presidential candidate to fulfill their needs, increasing the power of the executive branch, which would support its political party. However, when FDR, a democrat, was elected in 1932, he changed the game by providing even more power to the president, therefore increasing the power of the political parties they supported. With his “Relief, Recovery, Reform” policy he proposed not only the AAA which provided a solution to the abundance of food by slaughtering more than 64 million pigs and the TVA which gave electricity to the Tennessee Valley (favoring the Democratic South), but implemented the FDIC and Glass Steagall act which allowed government control in banks by insuring deposits between $2,500-5,000 and separating banks from insurance. Unsurprisingly, this concept was similar to Hamilton’s proposed banking systems. Overall, FDR showed the power of the executive branch in his years of office. This presidential power later allowed for Lyndon B. Johnson to passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting discrimination in public facilities based off race, religion, national origin, and gender. This was never thought possible if it weren’t for the rise of presidential power prior. However, this filled the South, whose Jim Crow Laws were strictly enforced, full of rage. This meant that the South, who was originally Democratic, turn towards the Republicans, and vice versa. The following election of 1968, the South stuck to their resolution and voted for Richard Nixon, a republican. This therefore formed the modern contrast between the Democratic and liberal North with the Republican and conservative South. Even in the last election of 2016 this can be shown, as Trump and Hillary supporters created flame wars across all social media platforms and creating fiery political debates that are so aggressive that it appears comedic. Therefore, the formation of political parties was inevitable and created the current electoral system we see today.  </p>

	<h2 id="second">Technology and Innovation</h2>
	<p>Beginning in the mid-18th century, major innovations were created in the North East, making it a region of incredible industry. For example, this included the Spinning Jenny in 1764, the first powered textile-machine, invented by James Hargreaves. With this, factories became more efficient, but the need for transportation, whether it be the transportation of cotton from the south to the factories, or to ports to be shipped overseas, was still immense. Therefore, with the abundance of resources and cheap labor, the creation of railroads became very profitable. Already, the government began implementing the transcontinental railroad in 1869, connecting the “Wild West” with the rest of the U.S. for the first time, and making transportation much cheaper. However, those who controlled the railroads controlled America, and Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish immigrant looking for success, decided to partake in this war of railroads in order to improve his company, the U.S. Steel Corporation. Other industries began looking for railroads to benefit themselves as well. John D. Rockefeller, for example, saw these railroads as an opportunity to ship crude oil to his own company, Standard Oil, established in 1870. With his innovations, turning crude oil into paraffin or petrol was much simpler, and allowed for the public to work even after the sun had set. </p><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Standard_Oil_Company_1878.JPG">
	 <p>Unfortunately the advancement of innovation and industry also advocated for harsh working conditions. However, the innovation of photography and media made reporting much more successful in the early 20th century. Muckrakers, reporters who sought to reveal the tragedy of various factories to the nation, began working to expose corrupt corporations. For example,  Upton SinClair, a socialist author who wrote “The Jungle,” exposed the unsanitary meat packing industry, whose owners apparently advocated for efficiency over quality, uncaring whether what they were shipping was rat, or even human meat. This eventually reached the government, who not only created the Meat Inspection Act, but also the Pure Food Act for all culinary industries in 1906. However, the hunger for information quietly grew, leading up to an even larger mass media platform, the Internet. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, allowing for literally anyone with a computer, (whether it be at work, home, or a local library), access to the world’s archive of information with a click of a button. Railroads may have connected nations, but the Internet had connected the entire world. However, even later in the beginning of the 21st century, the development of social media, including Twitter in 2006, and Youtube in 2005 allowed anyone to put their voice and opinion for all to see. Even our current president had recognized its worth and attempts to use it to showcase anything from his political point of view to random opinions.
</p>
<h2 id="third">Labor Systems</h2>
<p>An even more influential part of America throughout its history was the establishment of various labor systems. In the early English settlements in the South for example, the headright system attracted many poor, single white males by promising 50 acres for anyone who paid passage to the New World in 1618. However, because transportation was both expensive and risky, many fell under the rule of indentured servitude, which bound both men and women who couldn’t pay to a master or several years in Jamestown and the Chesapeake Bay. Because cotton was such an essential product in the enormous farms of the South, an equivalent supply of cheap labor was necessary, especially when more colonists either were released from service, or immigrated from England. Slave labor, therefore, started to become crucial. It began in 1600 when Spain and Portugal brought slaves from West Africa to the New World and England. However, it wasn’t until the 19th century did it slowly affect America’s political system. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 prevented any from escaping to the North. This caused the slave population to exponentially increase, greatly outnumbering their white oppressors. However, the brutality of their treatment in these vast numbers eventually lead to Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing slaves only in the South during the end of the Civil War. This also lead to amendments XIII, in 1865, freeing slaves. However, despite this, the south refused to give up their source of labor so easily. As a result, borrow plantations were implemented between 1860-1881, trapping many former slaves into sharecropping, gaining no profit with all earrings delivered to their plantation owner. </p><br>
<p>However, in the search for improved working conditions, many blacks had traveled north where there were many industrial openings during the Great Migration. But because of many advancements such as scientific management and properly timing workers, competition was fierce and pay was little. Because of the harsh conditions, tragedies such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911, with over 140 workers dying in flame in 1911 due to the lack of building regulations. This fortunately resulted in the Frances Perkins, the first female secretary of labor.</p><p><img src="http://www.pophistorydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/1940s-rosie-photo4-50.jpg"> Her ideals helped lead to the rise of women in the 20th century, breaking their past social restraints. Therefore, when almost all men were drafted to fight in WWII between 1939-1945, the government advocated for women to work in industries in the creation of weapons and ammunitions. Originally work for only males, it easily became work for anybody. Therefore, once the war was over, women proudly refused to return their line of work. Now, in the modern world, the past working conditions have almost equivalent to all in the 21st century. However, studies have shown that women are only arguably paid 80% as much as men. However, this all because of America’s history of working conditions.
</p>
<h2 id="fourth">Religious Influence</h2>
<p>Religious controversy was also very essential in shaping today’s American culture. It was King George III’s persecution of the Protestants that eventually lead to John Winthrop and over 900 migrants to sail aboard towards the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Later in 1644 as well, Anne Hutchinson, accused of heretical views, and Roger Williams even formed their own state simply for religious toleration. However, the Puritan belief that work is the only passageway to heaven eventually  drove New England into an industrial powerhouse, assisted by the First Great Awakening in the mid 18th century. However, this religious fervor continued all the way to the Second Great Awakening, where churches desired to reintroduce concepts from the Puritan era. This time, in the 1820’s, Baptists and Methodists spread the word of God, believing in equality of all class, race, and gender. Key figures such as Charles Finney guilted the public into religious belief with “Why Sinners Hate God,” explaining how every citizen who is not actively religious will rot in the afterlife, with only their free will to blame. </p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/1839-meth.jpg/270px-1839-meth.jpg"><p>The desire to fulfill God’s wishes eventually came into the political field with the concept of manifest Destiny, coined by John O’Sullivan in 1845, claiming that it was God’s plan for America to expand “from sea to shining sea,” even into Mexican territory. This unfortunately lead to the Mexican-American war from 1846-1848, only ending with the gain of California, fulfilling “America’s destiny.” However, America’s obsession with Christianity deeply hampered any scientific progression, especially in the South and West where the idea of Manifest Destiny was stronger, and possessed less religious variety than their Northern neighbors. For example, in 1919, a substitute teacher had attempted to teach the concepts of Evolution and Darwinism to a school in Tennessee. However, due to their Creationist beliefs, the instructor, William Jenning Bryan was sentenced to death in the Scopes (Monkey) Trial. </p><br><p>However, political figures in America used this radical point of view in WWII propoganda. For example, in FDR’s four freedoms speech, he reminds American soldiers that they are not only fighting for the freedom of religion, but also introduces many advertisements indicating that they should not worry as they will be led to heaven even upon death, hence the phrase “there are no atheists in foxholes.” This explains that in times of stress or fear, people will heavily rely back on religion. In addition, FDR implemented “under god” to the pledge and printed “In God we trust,” in American currency. Because America’s major opponent were the communists of Soviet Union later in the Cold War, this would easily separate the religious Western World from the atheists of the east. However, America’s religious sense also prevented societal change in many rural areas. For example, homophobia has plagued the nation even after (gay) marriage had become legal in all parts of the U.S. since 2015. This is often unfortunately supported by the belief that it’s nature is against God, and is listed as a sin in the Bible.(by the way, that is mostly due to mistranslations when writing the English version of the Bible) In any case however, religion has constantly shaped America. However, this was all caused by American Religion ever since the colonists' first arrival.</p>
<h2 id="fifth">Impact of Immigration</h2>
<p>Immigrants have also transformed the standard “American culture,” and introduced various ethnic groups to integrate with the white Protestant citizens, despite the constant sense of xenophobia. For example, between 1845-1852 the Great (Potato) Famine swept across Ireland which lead to many Irish citizens to immigrate to America in the hopes for a better farming life. However, they were not the first Irish to travel to America. About a century prior between 1763-1775, a group of frontiersmen of Scots-Irish origin traveled to the Northeast. Though they were being persecuted not only for being Irish and taking jobs (many industries refused to hire Irish,) but by being Catholic, they supported America in the French and Indian War and Pontiac’s Rebellion. From along the Susquehanna River in central Pennsylvania who formed a vigilante group to retaliate in 1763 against local American Indians in the aftermath of the battles. Because of the success the Irish had in the 18th century, this attracted both the Germans and the Chinese. About five million German immigrants traveled to the Midwest, especially in Cincinnati. Their culture influenced the Great Lakes region to the extent that to this day, more than 80% of the region claimed heritage to Germanic routes, and even developed a regional accent. Settlement on the nation’s western border also grew the desire to obtain even more land, assisting in the ideals of Manifest Destiny. Eventually, through several battles, America was able to obtain California, and with that came the gold rush which attracted even the Chinese. Despite the fact that these immigrants mostly worked in the mines, (completed) the Transcontinental Railroad, in restaurants, or laundromats, many of European descent frowned upon the new arrivals. This eventually resulted in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, only revoked in 1943. This made it impossible for any Chinese immigration. </p><br><p>However, the new openings that Western Expansion and the Chinese had left excited Europeans, especially those from the East, or South, such as Italy. Just like with the Chinese and Irish, they were poorly accepted. For example, two Italian immigrants by the names of Sacco and Vetti were charged with the murder of a paymaster in 1919 though were most likely innocent, enraging all other immigrants. However, with the new supply of citizens, industry in the North rose, and gave America a larger number of soldiers to fight prior in WWI. Additionally, the Italian mafia allowed for the contraband alcohol during Prohibition, gaining influence and power in underground communities. However, this increased the normality of xenophobia in America, and in addition of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japanese immigrants were instead put in camps. With the Cold War (1947-1991) as well, many Eastern European immigrants added to the Red scare in the 1950’s, the hysteria in fear of Communism and corrupting politics. However, because of past attacks as well as fear of loss of work, America has developed a poor reflex system with the increasing amount of immigrants. Our current president, for example, had only been elected due to the promise of the deportation of illegal Mexican immigrants, and 9/11 in 2001 created the fear of Middle Eastern immigrants and Muslims throughout the country. Therefore, not only have immigrants provided a stable work force, and military, but are also the reason for our current president coming into power.
